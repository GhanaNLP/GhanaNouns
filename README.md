# GhanaNouns

A lexicon of English noun phrases extracted from Ghanaian news, academic research, and speech data.  
The dataset provides a baseline vocabulary dataset for improving Machine Translation quality within the Ghanaian context.

---

## Rationale

Machine Translation systems often fail on region‑specific language varieties because they lack exposure to local vocabulary, collocations, and domains.  
Ghanaian English—while mutually intelligible with global English—exhibits distinct preferences in word usage, institutional references, and cultural concepts.

GhanaNouns, developed by Ghana NLP, addresses this gap by offering a high‑coverage, filtered set of noun phrases that appear naturally in Ghanaian news, academic writing, and speech.  
Our primary objectives are:

- Provide a baseline English‑noun lexicon sourced exclusively from authentic Ghanaian texts.
- Enable domain adaptation of MT models for Ghanaian English.
- Facilitate synthetic data generation (e.g., back‑translation, term‑augmented training) via frequency‑weighted vocabulary lists.
- Support human data collection (e.g., annotation, lexicon expansion) with a clean, deduplicated resource.
- Serve as a reference corpus for contrastive linguistic studies of Ghanaian vs. international English.

By releasing this dataset openly, we aim to lower the barrier for developing NLP tools that work for and with Ghanaian users.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

| Metric                             | Value      |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Total unique noun phrases          | **519,318**|
| … from news, research & speech     | 20,711     |
| … from news & research only        | 31,619     |
| … from news & speech only          | 14,157     |
| … from research & speech only      | 4,615      |
| … exclusively in news              | 156,445    |
| … exclusively in research          | 229,222    |
| … exclusively in speech            | 62,549     |
| Language‑filtered                  | FastText (lid.176, ≥0.7) |
| Minimum phrase length              | 1 word     |
| Maximum phrase length              | 10 words   |

All phrases are **lowercased** and stripped of leading stopwords.  
Proper nouns, acronyms, and non‑alphabetic tokens are **removed** during extraction.

### Noun-phrase validity filtering

An earlier release contained 806,317 phrases, but many were not usable nouns —
they were noun phrases carrying a removable qualifier (`astute sports
journalist`), two nouns joined by a conjunction (`crop residue and fertilizer
additions`), verb phrases, or transcription noise. `scripts/clean_nouns.py`
removes these in two stages: a rule prefilter for high-confidence cases, then a
`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` pass that judges each remaining phrase. The filter
scored **95.4%** accuracy on a held-out development set (97% of real nouns
kept, 94% of junk dropped), removing **286,999** entries in total:

| Removed for | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Not a valid noun (model judgement) | 184,039 |
| Conjoined nouns (`X and Y`) | 56,974 |
| Adverb qualifier | 26,579 |
| Speech disfluency (`uh`, `okay`) | 8,850 |
| Single-letter OCR debris | 6,003 |
| Stray determiner | 3,261 |
| OCR ligatures (`eﬀect`) | 1,293 |

Because the filter is not perfect, a small amount of noise remains and some
valid nouns were lost.

## ⚙️ Methodology (Summary)

1. **Sentence collection**  
   - 2.3M sentences from Ghanaian online news (2018–2024).  
   - 2.7M sentences from Ghana‑focused academic publications.  
   - Additional sentences from Ghanaian speech data.

2. **Noun phrase extraction** (`extract_np.py`)  
   - spaCy `en_core_web_sm`, GPU accelerated.  
   - Keep only **all‑lowercase** phrases.  
   - Strip leading stopwords.  
   - Deduplicate and count.

3. **Cleaning & merging** (`combine-all.py`)  
   - Remove non‑alphabetic characters.  
   - Remove all‑caps / multi‑capitalised tokens.  
   - Filter out adjectives (POS tagging).  
   - Merge news, research & speech counts.

4. **Language identification** (`filter-non-english.py`)  
   - FastText `lid.176.bin`, confidence ≥ 0.7.  
   - Retained **56.9%** of phrases as English.

5. **Noun-phrase validity filtering** (`clean_nouns.py`)  
   - Rule prefilter: conjunctions, adverb qualifiers, disfluencies, OCR debris.  
   - `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` judges each remaining phrase, 1 = keep / 0 = drop.  
   - Removed **286,999** entries; 95.4% accuracy on a held-out dev set.

## 🚀 Usage Ideas

### • Machine Translation adaptation  
Use the frequency distributions to **bias subword tokenisation** or to create **domain‑adapted vocabularies** for finetuning MT models (e.g., M2M100, NLLB, OPUS‑MT).

### • Synthetic data generation  
- **Term injection**: Replace general English nouns in parallel sentences with Ghanaian‑specific terms from the dataset.  
- **Back‑translation**: Use the phrase list as a target‑side lexicon to guide back‑translation from English into Ghanaian languages.  
- **Masked language modelling**: Pretrain a language model on Ghanaian English texts, then evaluate its lexical knowledge using this dataset.

### • Human data collection  
- **Annotation tasks**: Use the cleaned phrases as a starting pool for collecting translations into Ghanaian languages (Twi, Ga, Ewe, etc.) or for sentiment / topic labelling.  
- **Lexical resource expansion**: Crowdsource synonyms or regional variants based on the core list.

### • Linguistic analysis  
- Compare relative frequencies of common nouns across news, academic, and speech registers.  
- Identify terms that are **overrepresented** in Ghanaian English compared to general corpora (e.g., COCA, BNC).
